My device trees in branches

Current status as of 3/26/2018

carbon-cr-6.1, xenonhd-o compile and are being maintained.
aicp-o8.1 and aokp-oreo compile but are now inactive.
nitrogen-o2 fails to load kernel.
du-o8x-caf has no RIL/Gestures/stuff because the [vendor tree](https://github.com/yackback/proprietary_vendor_motorola_sanders/tree/du-o8x-caf) is just copied and renamed files from potter. 

Currently working to fix the kernel for nitrogen-o2.
